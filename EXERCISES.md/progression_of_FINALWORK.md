<h2> the progression of my final piece</h2>

<h4>original concept: 'eviction notice'
  -based off of a relationship between the home, environment and the couple inhabiting it
  -was interested in explorig the topic of domestic environments and treating it as a physical
  entity, as if it had eyes, thoughts and feelings adjacent to the narrators

<h3> dead end </h3>


<h4>I didn't get to the building part of this narrative, as I realised this was not a work I wanted to create
at this point in time. I found it difficult to write due to this, though I tried and wrote an abundance
of chapters for it. You can find a touched-up version of my original starting script in the exercises folder. 
I instead decided to dissect a different story, something more ambigious and 
alike the wandering, individually detached narrative of my prior twine experiment 'I think'. 
I regard this project as a first taste of what my narrative style can be like when amplified into hypertext, 
or becoming interactive. I recall in the beginning of the semester I noted my work is best absorbed in its most
simplistic form, and I'm glad I did not try to beat a dead horse with my prior text, as I feel, even though on paper
it appeared as a simple formula, I definetely had too much eager ambition to have kept it that way, and consistently
ruminated on how I could amplify it more and more, that I grew washed out of the eviction narrative and the text itself
suffered for it. </h4>


<h3>starting over with 'snow season'</h3>


<h4>I began this process, alike the last, writing it out in full. I feel because I knew I was trying to write
a hypertext piece, I curated my work into designated paragraphs revolving around notions of where
the story shifts in atmopshere/feeling. You can find my script in the excersises folder.

I have recently been into a darker, ominous atmopshere within my writing, about the shapes that environments
mould us into and our interactions with this. In exploring this, I came upon a similar theme of my prior work,
in the essence of homes, but more so in an individual, more explorative notion, uninvoled with other parties. 
I think one of the ideals that scared me most in the earlier work was that a relationship
tends to have a beginning and end, or a tension with resolution. Sometimes I get stuck when writing
unhappy narratives, as its not something I feel people want to manifest into their own fictional lives, 
especially if one may be feeling alike that in their daily life. This story is much more
ambigious, outlining the narrators mental state and how they feel the home is turning against them
physically and mentally. I would have been willing to dissect this in a longer format, but 
I feel pleasantly towards the length I have chosen, and think any longer it would be considered more
a drawl in its form due to the simplicity. </h4>

<h3>creating 'snow season'</h3>

<h4>my original intentions were to have an explorative narrative in 'eviction notice' that allowed
readers to interact in a non linear way of their choosing. With this text, and alot of short pieces I write,
I feel most successful in erasing the highly interactive objects. I have never been a writer for mysteries
or who-dunnits, and this was an ideal I battled heavily in my brainstorming of my final project, 
due to feeling like I wasn't showcasing anything fantastic like my peers may, who have crafted
formative narratives with multiple nooks and crannies.

However, I have come to realise that it is not so much my showcasing of things I could do, yet things
I wanted to do and could involve in my own practice after this semester, by utilising and educating
myself on mods of creation that work for my writing itself. 

I found this in simple changes to my twine story, such as background image to evoke mood and atmopshere,
which coincidentally enough, was one of the hardest tasks in sourcing a cohesive collection akin to
my narrative vibe. I found these on adobe stock after endless rabbit holes of similar image searches. </h4>

<h3> my intended aesthetic</h3>

<h4> My main goal was to create a work I would like to read myself, and I feel happy with 
the colour palette and sense of an almost desolate winter landscape I have curated alongside 
my story of intertwined atmosphere. I amplified this via a few elements, such as importing a likewise font,
testing with spacings, widths and positionings of text, bolding and changing text size. 
My curation of images was also used with tags, which I hadnt used prior, which made it easy for me to keep
track of these images within my CSS. I also used the element of dissolve for my text, allowing a softer transition between texts.

<h4>in reference to my prior twine piece, there is a bit of an upgrade in terms of formatting
and confidence. I've learnt to change text/hyperlink colours, fonts, sizings and placements, which add
a much more refined and enjoyable reading to my text.</h4>
