<h3>interacting with "the gathering cloud" by J.R Carpenter</h3>

<h5>When first interacting with this work, early in my introduction to electronic literature, I was left shaking my hands in the air at 
my computer going, <h3> " whats going on! " </h3> as elements propelled onto my webpage like hundreds of pop-ups. Images of animals approached
from the bottom of the screen, links fought to open at the expense of my slowly crippling macbook, and text boxes popped up where my cursor
lingered over highlighted words.

It uses a contrast of the definition of 'cloud', defining its existence as elemental versus that of the world wide web and data storage, all intertwining one through the other
through tenses of soft cloud-like historical imagery, almost eaten up by that of electronic imagery overwhelmed by the iconography and visuals barraging on the screen,
without personal interference or a way to make it stop. 


While the reader progresses through the narrative theirself via the links at the bottom, they have little say in whats being pushed towards them visually,
unlike the text boxes which only present if you seek them. 


My personal preference lies with more simplistic works, but this may be due to my ability to get visual motion sickness, where my eyes swim in my head and I have to lay down-
but undeniably, it seems this is the intended theme, to overwhelm you while you're trying to access this narrative, alike how data sources and the cloud is reptitively doing 
the same in everyday life. I think the concept is very successful, and even more so as my computer lagged trying to keep up with the rate of exploding imagery. I found
I could not give alot of general interest to the text itself due to these reasons, but it proves that each reader will have a unique experience, taking away different pieces 
of the text with each reading. From the few times I've revisted this piece, I still feel awfully overwhelmed, yet find I conquer and pay more interest to new things every time!


It is a successful piece of electronic literature due to these elements and the execution of the concept- having the ability to transcend feeling beyond text that would
not have been prevalent in standardized print text, and giving readers a multitude of ways to engage with the text repeatingly.
