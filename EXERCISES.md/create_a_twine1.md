<h4>my first twine experiment after being introduced to twine!</h4>

<body>
it is very tiny, very simple, and I was testing the waters with an easy, two choice format. 
  
As you can see, I have urls to websites embedded in the last two options, which required a bit of reading online to
figure out! 

Same with changing the colour of the background (twice!). 

I hadn't dabbled with importing fonts, CSS or 
github pages yet, but I think it was a valiant first experiment, and once you get into it, it is actually very fun!</body>
