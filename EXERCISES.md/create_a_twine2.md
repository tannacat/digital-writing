<h4> my second attempt at twine 
  
  you can find it here! (https://tannacat.github.io/I-think-twine-story/)</h4>


<body> this attempt was a much more thoughtful, lengthened process as I was introducing myself  
to an abundance of new elements to twine, including background image, text placement,
font and hosting my twine story via github.
this twine piece follows a genuine narrative and while it doesnt include a path of
back and forth (singular, linear narrative), 
I found the theme and presentation were great amplifiers of the text.
