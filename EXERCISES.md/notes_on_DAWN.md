<h1> Notes on Dawn (Assesment One) </h1>
<body>
  
* Story regarding themes of life and death.
  
* Uses isolated, desolate landscapes with muted colour palette.
  
* Abundance of nature imagery to add to the themes above.
  
* Layers transparencies, varying opacities with images and texts:

  -the fading in and out at varying speeds, makes many passages hard to read in contrast to others.
  
  -requires rereading the text over many times to collect all of the text.
  
  -uses this technique with background image also.

* Runs on a loop, allowing multiple digestions of text/environment.
  
* Includes audio:
  
  -audio sounds like static, an interference of crunching sounds/water.

  -the loop of audio get irritating very quickly due to the grating sounds.

* The idyllicy of environmental images versus the audio creates a conflict of emotion:
 
  -this could be intentional, regarding the conflicting feelings of the narrator.

* Minimalist interface:
  
  -text, photograph, audio, no interactive elements.

* Appearance of a figure in the narrative, "she will rise":
  
  -further inclusion to the life, death, spiritual narrative that coinsides with the text of mother, father and general depressing narrative.
