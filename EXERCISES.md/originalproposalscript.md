<h1>my proposal script for presentation</h1>

<h3>So this is my narrative titled Eviction Notice- it comes from a delirious passage I wrote a couple of weeks ago that details a flailing relationship inside and with a home.</h3>

<body>
Through this work I want to discuss the relatable topics of intimacies, especially in sharing spaces, the alterations of people as independents and in a relationship over time, and I think my biggest theme is that of environments. How places can be more tangible than the structures themselves. In in the Dream House, which i'm sure alot of you have read, there's the overarching notion of rooms/structures taking on a less physical and mor spiritual meaning in the dictation of Carmens passages of time/memories. Ever since I read Deborah Levy’s, Real Estate, where she talks about having a folio in her head of all her ‘properties’,
I’ve begun to see that inadvertently we carry these ideals of home-structures in differing ways in our heads. I think its quite similar to relationships with people.
  

My moodboard, muted browns, streams of sunlight, feelings that evoke nostalgic memories. I want to include images perhaps to evoke this, with some experimentation I’ll see what fits just right with my narrative as I explore its creation. 
I got all of these off adobe Stock for inspiration. Though most of the narrative is centered on the ‘apartment’ ideal, I intend to include things referencing outside this space. 
A simplistic story that stems off a main passage of text that reads almost as a personal note. It reads earnestly, non fictionally, although it uses fictional places and people, I feel it most likely resonates from a place within myself.


Readers click through links off main passage to anecdotes that resemble varying chapters/stages of the story between the relationship and home. 
Told through a first person narration- one member of the relationship.
Relies on use of emotions/relatability through anecdotal-like passages. 


My Goal would be to use Twine, I’m growing more comfortable with it every use and find it fits with my simplistic narrative style. I created one last week that I feel amplified my narrative without the use of bombardment of other elements that tends to take away from my writing. I get overwhelmed initially with the idea of digital writing thinking it has to use multiple elements and be highly interactive- forgetting that it stands for more beyond these inclusions! 


It’s about how it amplifies my narratives in regards to me! I also intend to look at other options such as website builders, in regards to the layout of this narrative, I think I will brainstorm on a piece of paper the ways that I would like it to lay out and be explored and then work to find the best fit.
Open to exploring website like options, especially in regards to the floor plan idea or symbolism of things within the home. Icons you can click through that may be present in the home etc that would add to the initial text.


I’m open to experimenting with audio inclusions, or video. Perhaps inclusions of handwritten or drawn aspects or mementos for a personal feel. I intend The initial text to be the ‘notice’ itself.


I think alongside my written narrative, I make something more visual for contrast if I have the time– last week when I made a bitsy game I found not only a lot of enjoyment but it gave me inspiration for creating a narrative which I feel intertwines with the traversing through rooms/places and memories. This visual aspect is definitely something I will toss and turn with as I begin to build it. 


I have a desired idea to use some photoshop- I’ve dabbled in stop motion etc etc, and or transparent text, like when I studied dawn. 
The way in which these chapters are absorbed are up to the readers discretion, maybe it may paint a different story based on the way the anecdotes are absorbed, evidently dealing with themes contrasting themes of sadness/happiness, comittal/non-commitance. The notion of the story is that some things are unavoidable no matter the way in which the steps are taken, the destination is the same, which I guess can be a sad truth to most things. Evidently this is all still a work in progress and subject to a lot of change! But my main goal is to create a simple, nostalgic narrative outlining these themes of environment, home and intimacy in a more amplified way than able in print literature. Whether this be highly interactive, or using simple click-through methods and visual aids! We will see!
