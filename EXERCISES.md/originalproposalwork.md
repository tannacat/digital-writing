<h1>my original final work</h1>
<h6>this has since been scrapped as I realised I didnt want to work on this- I was quite delusional thinking I'd like to write from a 
male perspective about a relationship, two things which I inherently do not desire to do! Whatever was I on?!
I workshopped this text many and many times but to no avail, some things just need to be left dead and not to stir! I think it is much better as 
an undissected standalone piece, yet I did dabble with it so often I now find it unrecognizable from the narrative I first liked. </h6>
I think this is in our best interest. Though you mention I’ve always been headstrong and have tendencies to bury coffins long yet occupied– I’ve begun sitting up at night and on trains with these concerns sat next to me like a large overnight bag. 

Some mornings It brushes its teeth next to me, sits between us at the table eating leftovers from beneath my chair like a placid dog. I would rather it didn’t go on too long, hitting the dead-end stalemate, concluding with us sitting about feeling sorry for ourselves with our misconstrued sentences all over the floor. 

I know you can have a poor temperament for situations out of your control, though it was my maddening that sent you through the door one too many times. My resentment in the following minutes always scrambled around at your departure in a frenzied manner. I’d have to peg it to the rafts of the fire escape to let the wind wipe it clear of all disposition or by the time you’d walked around the block and cleared your head, it would have devoured the whole flat. 

I know how it seems, if we were smaller in a tiny house and two large eyes peered in through the living room window and sourced the scene for what it was. Your hair in the bathroom sink, my leftovers in the kitchen; our wild house plant on the coffee table souring at the ends. You and I poking and prodding, at every living wound in the home as if the walls would ooze and cry out humanely, though never enough for us to feel shame about our enjoyment at one another's hurt. It would watch two bystanders performing scenes one and two in left and right wings- there is no inch left of the apartment to devour so we took to each other and blamed the home as an assailant for never stepping in.

I think often about what it would be like if I played dead and ran to the other side of Boston. Shaved my hair, myself of  indecisions and ran at the first sight of conflict or the shift in the air that signalled your impending entrance to every room. I sense it too well like a scent spent years erasing with the contents of a bottomed out barrel of bleach, the texture of a hand spent too long submerged in scalding water. There is nothing I can do that dismisses the infractures down my spine akin to all items with years of wear, though I’ve wiped and wept my fingerprints clean in hopes no one would recognise me at the bottom of the basin.
