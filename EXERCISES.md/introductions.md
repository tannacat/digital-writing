<h3> expectations</h3>
<body> 
 My impression of digital writing prior to this lab was a very blank slate in regards to expectations. I had assumed it would be writing for web-based platforms, as my exposure to electronic literature prior had been slim to nothing. The current way I had interacted with any writing ‘online’ would be through online journals or magazines. 

In coming to learn about electronic literature and the syllabus of the course, I was eager to try my best at creating something physical and interactive that transcended beyond the print page, which I had never tried before. In the beginning it seemed hard to wrap my head around the ideals of coding/creating on a digital platform, as I don’t pride myself on my intelligence regarding such things– alongside an amazement/shock of being exposed to such a large part of literature I’d been unaware of! 
In the beginning of semester I stated my goal was to solely create something– an open ended goal full of many possibilities, and one I feel I will happily achieve.

<h3> my writing practice</h3>
<body> 
My own practice consists of creative nonfiction writing, with a focus on prose and poetry. My work is a regular product of environment and place-based narrative, I’d regard these elements as my tools and techniques, due to the context of my work. They help me regulate emotions and form grander perspectives about the regularity of life and environments, or are used as a landscape for my own delusional daydreams of living. 

A regularity to nonfiction, especially in regards to mundanity and domestic life, is the monotony– which for a long time I viewed as a restraint, curated by myself due to my own lack of experience. But in slowly learning different formats and mediums, I find this ideal may just be a by-product of my lack of knowledge regarding my own practice. I feel that learning and exploring avenues of digital writing will open up my practice and allow me to feel much more explorative with my avenues of creativity regarding non-fiction.
