<h4>below is the work I created in class, taking an old poem of mine and going crazy trying to
  find each noun and its seventh counterpart in a dictionary on a monday afternoon.... I recall disliking this
  outcome, which I think is because of the use of the word 'dogger', which feels oddly...cringe.... but viewing it later, its 
  much more enjoyable! Most likely due to the fact I have not touched a physical dictionary since.

<h3>original poem:</h3>

<body>
  
Dog at my door

With a canine, nuzzled into the flesh

Of a taut baby rabbit 

Head nestled into to the crook

Of it’s shoulder, its worn to a colour

Of white mixed with matter, with blood and the dirt

Of the garden the seeds are torn

Up from the ground and the dog paces sadly

Down the corridor of the house crying

</body>


<h3>after the n7, dictionary shenanigan:</h3>

<body>
  
**Dogger** at my **doornail**
  
With a **canned**, nuzzled into the **fleuret**

Of a taut baby **rabid** 

**headcount** nestled into to the crook

Of it’s **shovelhead**, its worn to a **colourist**

Of white mixed with **maturation**, with **bloodline** and the **disabuse**

Of the **gargle** the **seeing** are torn

Up from the **groundling** and the **dogger** paces sadly

Down the **corrosion** of the **housebuyer** crying

</body>
