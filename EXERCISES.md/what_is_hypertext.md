<h3>what is hypertext fiction?</h3>

<body> Hypertext fiction is an experimental form of literature that offers alternate storylines, tenses and settings to 
fictional work via interactive hyperlinks.

It amplifies narrative by differing the standards and choices of chronology/linear stories associated
heavily with print, and allows an interactive essence with hyperlinks that make the reader 
interacting and choosing these selections the insitgator, rather than just the consumer.

It can differ from standard fiction due to these elements, but also heavily due to the openness of the genre,
which produces alot of fiction that does not have a designtated start, end or purpose, nor set length or time of
play. In alot of these works I have interacted with, there isn't a particular goal alike a video game, or 
such things as levelling up- I'd more so describe it as walking into a house, snooping around at the 
interiors and wandering through rooms, and leaving whenever one pleases, which is what I enjoy alot. There is always an option
to click out, and can always be differed through outside environmental factors such as personal context, 
whether the tv is on in the back while the individual reads, whether it is at night versus day. And due to its
online structure there is an accessibility not found in general print or games that would allow for these 
multitudes of perspective. 

I have viewed many proposals from peers under a mystery/thriller genre that deliberates with these right and wrong choices, and find them a treat to view- and standardly, though there may be a leading background objective to a story like 'make it out of the haunted house', it is the online platform that takes this already pre-concieved notion from standard print text, and adds a plethora of variables the author has not much of a say in when in the hands of an audience. 

Easily you can plan hypertext fiction like a regular story, and implement some structures to it that allow it to be interactive and branching, but I feel it would only work in favour if hypertext fiction had been absorbed prior and the author was open and or knowledgable about its elements how the story may be enhanced through it. In writing pieces for my own hypertext stories, though the narrative at its core was a short story format I would regularly write, I was aware in constructing sentences that would allow the implement of hypertexts and carried a more distant definition than regarded in a typical fiction print novel.

In this instance, a physical mindmap may help being able to plot, or colour tagging things based on varying routes. I tend to write my pieces in short paragraphs where I feel shifts in the atmopshere or story that could easily be bridged together via hyper link.
