<h2>Using Bitsy</h2>
<body>Bitsy's format reminds me of an old school arcade game- think space invaders, or even undertale.

Though I don't think this form fits into my narrative practice, it was a highlight of my semester, pawing over
my little pixel characters and making pixel environments. If I had alot more time, I'm sure
I would have created something much better than my initial experiment; but in saying so, what I
created I was very excited by!

I was very invested in the process of creating, I think due to its reward of immediacy, when you 
change or create something it is immediately apparent on the screen, unlike waiting for anything to update
or writing code and hoping it transistions well after comitting changes. 

The story I went with is super simple! The cat avatar walks through a couple of landscpapes and interacts 
with a friend/some elements. There is a little text, but mostly for an experiment and not a narrative.

I think I would try this out at a later date, whether it be for fun or for my genuine practice. It would be 
interesting to view how my work would transition over to such an abstract platform. 

It's a platform that can get you very fixated, and is a game in itself! </body>
