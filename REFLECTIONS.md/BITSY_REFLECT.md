<h2>Using Bitsy</h2>
<body>Bitsy's format reminds me of an old school arcade game- think Space Invaders, or even Undertale.

Though I don't think this form fits into the end goal of my narrative practice, it was a highlight of my semester.
Pawing over my little pixel characters and making pixel environments was something of a childhood dream, and in short and simple 
words: awfully fun.

If I had given more time to creating a genuine narrative, I'm sure
I would have crafted something much better than this initial experiment; but in saying so, what I
created was the result of an oddly long process of learning for such a tiny thing.
The platform though easy to use, is only easy once you realise what is going on and which elements create what. 

I was very invested in the process of creating, I think due to its reward of immediacy- when you 
change or create something it is immediately apparent on the screen, unlike waiting for anything to update
or writing code and hoping it transistions well after comitting changes. 

The story I went with is super simple! The cat avatar walks through a few pixel landscpapes and interacts 
with a friend/some elements. There is a little text, but mostly for the purpose of experimenting and not a narrative.

I think I would try this out at a later date, whether it be for fun or for my genuine practice. It would be 
interesting to view how my work would transition over to such an abstract platform.
I would reccommend this to anyone who wants to fiddle around with either something to do, or a method of amplifying
ones writing. A revisit is definitely in my future! </body>
