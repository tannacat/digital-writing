<h2>snow season</h2>
<body>This work, as my final piece, showcases what I've learnt over the semester- having been someone with no knowledge
of electronic literature, to creating my very own.

I wanted to capture a simple narrative; inspired by isolated weather landscapes, feeling uncomfortable in your body and in your home. It is a bit of a hit and miss in regards of my own life- I identify with alot of these notions. 

I used the vast winter imagery in the backgrounds to create an atmopshere alongside the writing- a simple, relaxed font with a dissolve feature between switching paragraphs via the hyperlinks. 

While I did contemplate the idea of having a multiple choice narrative, I settled on what best amplified my own practice, which 
was built alike a chronological story. I see digital writing as a vessel for external elements, especially hypertext fiction, in that once it leaves the creators hands it can constitute a plethora of experiences via contexts and audiences. 

Overall, I'm proud of what I've created, overcoming obstacles of confidence and unease, switching my final project idea after a curated proposal. 
In creating this I've not only created a text I enjoy, in a voice I find comfort in, but discovered a new way this can be amplified from beyond the page. 

I would have liked to try and implent an audio element, but I did not want to put too much on my plate. I can always do this later 
with other experimental works within my practice.
