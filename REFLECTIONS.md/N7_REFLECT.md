<h2>N7 Poem</h2>

<body>Another method that can be done manually, but has an easier digital version that consists of just 
pasting in text and letting the

**worldwideweb**
  scour the dictionary for you. 

  It's an interesting approach that I hadn't heard of prior, though I shortly learnt the results of
  my own poems in combination with this method, produced questionable results. 

I was left thinking there were many mundane words in the english dictionary that, for the life of you, 
you just cannot poeticise. But in reflecting, its certainly the perspective in which you perform this task
in. 

I wouldn't use this method as a conclusive addition to the work- but rather a starting point for a further experiment, in
attemtping to create a new or similar poem around the generated words. 

I don't have documentation of my very first digital N7 work; I mostly scoffed and thought the process was a bit of baloney and closed the browser with a concerning immediacy, but I did 
revisit it with a new text, one that wasn't as deep and soulful as the prior poetry I'd wrote. 
To resist any touch-ups or refined work, I wrote this passage straight into the html in less than a few minutes. 
I feel approaching this method with work you havent fawned and picked over already gives you a much better outlook
and perspective to its creations.
