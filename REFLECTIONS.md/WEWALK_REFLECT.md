<h2> We Walk to You </h2>

<body> This experiment was one of my favourites, as it was seemingly very easy, but one I could see
working with my own narrative work.
  
Its elements reminded me of 'Dawn', studied in my assesment 1 task, with the dissapearing, coming and 
goings of text, but this form played with generative appearing and dissapearing text forms, 
never knowing of the descriptors it will pluck from your list of choices.

I went for a environmental/bacterial theme, wondering if I used similar connected words, it would produce an interactive poem
easily enjoyed- hence the use of words like fungi and outdoorsmen. The result, after messing around
a few times with presentation, is something I genuinely enjoy- and with a few attentive fixes would be a work
I wouldn't be hesitant to share.

In saying this, I think its random-generation is the best of its aspects, and I can only imagine how fun it would be to implement 
contrasting words and ideals instead of a consistent theme.

It's an easy remix to reuse time and time again, by changing different things like colours, fonts, alignment and timings.
