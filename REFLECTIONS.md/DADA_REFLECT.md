<h2>Dadaist Poem</h2>

<body>This concept is something I feel you come to when you've tried everything
else to save you from your writers block. I only say this as I think I've attempted to do
similar things in the past to provoke a thought or two, in recycling my old work.

This platform is evidently a much more friendly version, especially in consideration with the in 
class exercise of cutting up bits of newspaper. I also feel that way is a bit more limiting, due to
personal prejudice and confusions, while using an automated element has no care to it. Alot of what you get is 
bizarrely random- and at first I did think it was quite stupid. The more I participate in it though, the more
I enjoy it! 

I'd definetely like to use other pieces of work in this format, or even just implement random words. 
There is a question posed here regarding originality though.....
