<h2>Twine Piece</h2>

<body>The glories of a simple platform; an effective way for narrative storytelling and an ability to shapeshift 
a page into any atmopshere or environment you desire. 
  
First approaching Twine, there was an urge to create the most
interwoven who-dunnit mystery story due to the use of hyperlinks. I seemed to get a bit starry-eyed by
ambition that I could be the new age Agatha Christie, despite having never produced mystery content in my life.


I'd actually seen similar things before- I remember there being similar narrative styles on Twitter of all places- 
different threads leading you to different options of a story. 

They were quite popular a few years back with fandoms of tv shows and bands, and only now do I realise how 
much effort must have gone into producing this content on a format like Twitter, when working with an easy format like Twine. 

This was the first piece I took a little bit of time on, trying out new things like background image and fonts. While
it still remains quite simplistic, there is a definite difference between my first initial creation (in exercises), versus this.
It fits the simplicity of the narrative quite well and proved that my work could transition to electronic literature.
I'd always had the fear that my work was too boring or mundane- but I'd never had the option
or resources prior to experiment with it beyond a page like such.

My final piece uses Twine, and it's amazing to see how far I've come in confidence and knowledge. I will most 
likely use this platform later for future endeavours in my practice. I also find
in thinking about writing for electronic literature, it stretches a part of my brain different
to that of my regular non-fic print writing, so it's a very welcome and explorative change.</body>
